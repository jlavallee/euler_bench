=begin
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.

my @fib = (1,2); #start the list as stated in the problem
my $stop = 4000000; #where to stop
while 1 { # stop case is in the loop
   my $next = @fib[@fib.end-1] + @fib[@fib.end];
   last if $next > $stop;
   @fib.push( $next );
}
say [+] grep { $_ % 2 == 0 }, @fib;
